# PHPGuard Free

**Scan WordPress plugins safely before installing.**
Prevent PHP crashes, fatal errors, WSOD, and downtime by detecting critical issues *before* they ever touch your live site.

PHPGuard runs advanced PHP syntax and crash-risk checks in a safe process — so you don’t gamble with uptime, revenue, or client trust.

## 🚀 What PHPGuard Does

- ✔️ Detects PHP syntax errors

PHPGuard tells you whether your next install or update is:
